[Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) starter (with [Alpine.js](https://github.com/alpinejs/alpine) included) created for fast prototyping of web templates in the [Pinegrow](https://pinegrow.com/tailwind-visual-editor/) editor.

Use this as a template.

Commands:
1. Install dependencies with `npm install`
2. Run `gulp` command in terminal
3. Open project in Pinegrow Web Editor with [Tailwind Extension enabled](https://pinegrow.com/tailwind-visual-editor/).

Try to edit `public/index.html` inside Pinegrow Editor - the browser should automatically reload after saving this file (or any file with .html extension inside this folder).

You can also edit files inside `src` folder. The browser should be automatically reloaded after making any changes. The JS and CSS files will be processed and copied to `public/assets/` directory.

Any files located in `src/static` folder will be copied over to `public/assets/static`.

There is no code or image optimization here to keep dependencies minimal. This starter was created only for quick prototyping of the website layout during initial phase of development. When you're satisfied with the results, you can easily copy everything to your "main" project based on - for example - [Gatsby.js](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/), [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/) or whatever tool you are using and optimize everything properly there.
